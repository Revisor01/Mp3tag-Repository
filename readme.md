# Audiobook/Music Tag Scraper

This is my modified custom web sources/actions/export for [mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).

Updated tags using sources-->use actions to order folders.

This helps me make sure all audiobooks are tagged properly, have the correct filenames, and have the proper folder structure.  
This ensures consistency across Plex.
