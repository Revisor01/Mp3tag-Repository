# Audiobook/Music Tag Scraper for Mp3tag

This is my modified custom web sources/actions/export for [mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).

Updated tags using sources-->use actions to order folders.

## Sources:
### VGMdb.net
Search by Album: [VGMdb#Search by &Album.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/Audible.com%23Search%20by%20Album.src)

Search by URL: [VGMdb#U&RL.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/VGMdb%23U%26RL.src)


### Audible.com
Search by Album:[Audible.com#Search by Album.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/Audible.com%23Search%20by%20Album.src)

This will get artist image and bio: [Audible.com#Authors images.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/Audible.com%23Authors%20images.src)


### Goodreads.com (WIP)
Search by book+writer: [Goodreads#Goodreads.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/Audible.com%23Search%20by%20Album.src)

This will get artist image and bio(good to work with audible): [Goodreads#Author image.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/Goodreads%23Author%20image.src)


### Amazon: (WIP) This is in progress
Search by artist: [Amazon#Amazon.co2.src](https://github.com/romanoh/Mp3tag-Repository/blob/master/data/sources/Amazon%23Amazon.co2.src)





This helps me make sure all audiobooks are tagged properly, have the correct filenames, and have the proper folder structure.  
This ensures consistency across Plex.
