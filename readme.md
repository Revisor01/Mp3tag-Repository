# Audiobook Tag Scraper

This is my modified custom web sources for [mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).


I have add it an Action and an Export file, to use together.

This helps me make sure all audiobooks are tagged properly, have the correct filenames, and have the proper folder structure.  This ensures consistency across Plex.
